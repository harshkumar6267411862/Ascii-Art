🎨 ASCII Art Generator using Pure Python

This project demonstrates how ASCII art can be created using only basic Python logic, without relying on image-processing libraries. The artwork is generated by treating the terminal as a grid and manually mapping characters to specific row and column positions using loops and conditional statements.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how visual structures can be represented using text characters. Each character printed in the terminal corresponds to a coordinate in a 2D grid, similar to pixels in an image. By carefully choosing characters of different visual density, the project creates a detailed ASCII sketch using pure logic.

🎯 Objectives

Understand how images can be represented as a grid of rows and columns

Strengthen fundamentals of loops and conditional statements

Learn how character density affects visual output

Build a complex output without using external libraries

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

for loops (nested)

if–elif–else conditions

Functions

Basic console output
